// need to implement: 
// Option to select which term you are currently in (turn 20203 into Fall 2020 for example)
// Autofill while searching, like webreg
  // to do this: 
  // When user clicks on search textfield, get .deptsN() and then filter that
  // when dept has been confirmed, get the courses in the dept with .courses()
  // when specific course is confirmed, show the sections in that course and prompt user to pick

//IDEA:
// When user decides to publish assignment and it's very similar in name to another assignment, it asks if they want to merge the assignment with an already existing one
// Can also view crowdsourced assignments by CLASS, by PROFESSOR and also by SECTION
