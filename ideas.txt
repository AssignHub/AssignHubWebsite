when publishing assignments use sockets to show new ones for people enrolled in those classes

improve UI so stuff isn't cramped
- for calendar, set a min width for columns and convert it to horizontal scroll once it overflows

add a feedback form

be able to edit assignments

checkboxes to only display your instructor, or only your section

be able to change color of a class

be able to block a user's public assignments from showing up in your public assignment area

add validation for body/query params

option to set duedate as "due by class time"

character limit on assignment name

"Overdue" section of todo list

when you click on a friend, it shows you how many classes you share

FIXBUG: if you have two of the same course, it will only show in one of the colors
- maybe just disallow adding courses with same courseid

CHANGE database to name stuff "classes" instead of "courses"
- remember to change frontend so that assignment.course becomes assignment.class
- also change all the courseObjectIds
